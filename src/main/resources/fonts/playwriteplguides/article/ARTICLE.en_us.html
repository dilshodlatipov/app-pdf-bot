    Playwrite Polska Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+PL">Playwrite Polska</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Poland’s <em>podstawa programowa</em>, or core curriculum, is published by the
	<em>Ministerstwo</em>, and available online, where it is continuously
	maintained. It mentions handwriting education very briefly, stating that the
	country’s goal is that students must learn to write by hand, legibly and
	fluently, in sentences and continuous text.
</p>
<p>
	In Poland, the prevalent handwriting education model is a loopless,
	fully-joined vertical cursive, and students are taught upper and lower cases
	simultaneously. Handwriting primers show samples of this style alongside
	instructions on how to draw them. When it comes to reading, students learn that
	through a serif typeface.

<h4>Playwrite Polska Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
