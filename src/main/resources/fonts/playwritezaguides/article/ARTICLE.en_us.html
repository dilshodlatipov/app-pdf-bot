    Playwrite South Africa Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+ZA">Playwrite South Africa</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Through its website, the Department of Basic Education produces and distributes
	documents that outline curricula, educational goals and guidelines,
	implementation notes, and assessment policies. The Curriculum Assessment Policy
	Statements (CAPS) outlines the steps and objectives for handwriting instruction
	and specifies that students learn motor skills in Grade R, and unjoined upper
	and lowercase letters in Grade 1. They then gain speed and proficiency in Grade
	2, and proceed to cursive writing. The document does not, however, prescribe
	any handwriting models that should be used for teaching.
</p>
<p>
	Despite the absence of a recommended model, teachers, specialized publishers,
	and educational resource providers have converged on their choice of fonts for
	handwriting education. Geometric “ball and stick” letters are used for the
	first stage of instruction, and a very slanted continuous cursive style is used
	thereafter.

<h4>Playwrite South Africa Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
