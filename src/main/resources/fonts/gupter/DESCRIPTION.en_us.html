<p>Gupter is a condensed serif font inspired by early 20th century English fonts such as Times New Roman.</p>

<p>The family excels in small spaces due to its large x-height and condensed letterforms. The light stems and subtle details give it a gentle personality and a nice color balance on the page.</p>
