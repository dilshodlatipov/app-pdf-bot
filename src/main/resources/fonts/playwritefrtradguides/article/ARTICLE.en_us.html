    Playwrite France Traditionnelle Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Trad">Playwrite France Traditionnelle</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The <em>‘écriture cursive’</em>, or
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Trad">
    traditional vertical cursive</a>, is the most used approach to handwriting teaching in schools in France. Its
	forms are inspired by the <em>‘Lettre Ronde’</em>, originally written with a
	broad nib pen and ink. Students learn <em>‘écriture cursive‘</em> by writing
	letters over <em>Séyès lines</em>, which are introduced during kindergarten
	(age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical
	guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and
	descending strokes.
</p>
<p>
	In an attempt to reform and modernize handwriting teaching in schools, the
	Ministère released two digital typeface families in 2013 —
	<em>Écriture A</em> by Laurence Bedoin-Collard and Heloísa Tissot, and
	<em>Écriture B</em>, by Marion Andrews. Both fonts follow a
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Moderne">
    modern cursive style</a>
	and are available for free on the Ministère’s website, along with information
	for teachers about the shapes and proportions of letters, and how to connect
	them to form words in the most logical way possible.

<h4>Playwrite France Traditionnelle characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
