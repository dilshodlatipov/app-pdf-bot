    Playwrite Việt Nam Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+VN">Playwrite Việt Nam</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

	In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was
	adopted in 2002. It is called the <em>mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt</em>, or
	<em>Vietnamese official cursive script</em>, and has been in use from academic
	year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both
	upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught
	print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that
	make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1
	to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they
	graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.

<h4>Playwrite Việt Nam Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
