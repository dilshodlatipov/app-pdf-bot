    Iansui is based on Fontworks' <a href="https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/Klee">Klee Semibold font</a>, which is a script font handwritten by pencil or pen. Its quiet design has an elegant and slightly feminine look that sets itself apart from traditional script and textbook fonts. Ideal for body text. Iansui further modifies the existing design to meet the Ministry of Education's requirements for Taiwanese use.
