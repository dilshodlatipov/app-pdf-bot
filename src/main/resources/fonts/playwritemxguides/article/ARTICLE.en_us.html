    Playwrite México Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+MX">Playwrite México</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Since the 1992 educational reform, the curricula for primary education no
	longer provide details about handwriting instruction or specific writing
	models. Moreover, it grants teachers the freedom to choose teaching methods for
	reading and writing instruction during the earliest stages. However, nearly all
	private schools and most public ones teach cursive writing — either alongside
	or sequentially — with print letters. But the resources they use for teaching
	cursive writing are privately acquired from publishing houses or created by
	teachers themselves.
</p>
<p>
	In this context, local type designers have been commissioned to create
	typefaces that match the styles familiar to teachers. These typefaces are
	usually similar to North American penmanship models, more likely, a derivative
	from the National Commission of Free Textbooks workbooks dating back to the
	1960s.

<h4>Playwrite México Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
