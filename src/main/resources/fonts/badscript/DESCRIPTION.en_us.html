<p>Bad Script started from a simple six-letter logotype and developed into a separate font, supporting Latin and Cyrillic character sets. It was completely made using a tablet to imitate casual and neat handwriting. Designed to resemble the designer's own handwriting, while making it systematic and smooth.

<p>The 2024 update improves kerning and offers better language support. Some bugs have been fixed, and the design has been enhanced.</p>
