	Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting
	styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models
	produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting
	taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th
	century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was
	prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.
</p>
<p>
	At the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting
	in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this
	situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways
	to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources
	for
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+IT+Trad">
    traditional handwriting</a>
	education, or introducing new teaching schemes. The
	<em>Scrittura Corsiva</em> modern cursive project has gained significant
	recognition among the latter.

<h4>Playwrite Italia Moderna Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
