    Playwrite Portugal Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+PT">Playwrite Portugal</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

<p>
	Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of
	handwriting only happens in the 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy
	in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. However, it
	should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the
	government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually
	begin with <em>‘letra impressa’</em>, or print script letters, starting with
	capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully
	joined, vertical cursive writing, known as <em>‘escrita vertical’</em>. There
	are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with
	<em>letra de mão/manuscrita</em>, or cursive letters from the beginning.

<h4>Playwrite Portugal Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
